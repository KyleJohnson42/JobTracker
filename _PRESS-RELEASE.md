There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  JobTracker

## Sub-Heading ##
  An application designed to help job seekers track their progress and keep motivation high.

## Summary ##
  JobTracker takes in details that you provide about job postings and keeps a list of all the jobs you have applied to. It also allows you to note which stage of the job search process you reached with that particular posting, and automatically calculates what percentage of applications have led to phone screens, what percentage of phone screens have led to interviews, and so on. With JobTracker, it's now so simple to watch the progress of your job search and see your sticking points backed by real numbers!

## Problem ##
  The job search can be a tedious process with no sense of progress. Job seekers often feel like they're throwing resumes into the void, and lose hope as a result.

## Solution ##
  In reality, the job search is just a numbers game; each application brings you a little closer to your goal. JobTracker helps you visualize this process, track your progress, identify problem spots, and keep your motivation up during the search!

## Quote from You ##
  "Unemployment is a burden that weighs down so many people today, and finding a way out of it is so often a mindless grind. JobTracker is designed to show those in the midst of it that each small step eventually adds up!"

## How to Get Started ##
  Using JobTracker is as simple as typing in a few brief pieces of info about the jobs you are interested in. From there, you can mark which stage of the application process you have reached for that particular posting, and JobTracker will automatically update and display your totals and your conversion rates to the different stages of the job search.

## Customer Quote ##
  "During my last job search, tracking my applications by hand seemed like a waste of time, so I didn't track them at all. I eventually lost count of the number of resumes I sent out, and the search started to feel endless. This time around, I'm using JobTracker, and seeing those totals grow each day really makes me feel like I'm doing something right and motivates me to keep going! The numbers even showed that I rarely made it past phone screens, so I was able to focus my efforts on nailing those."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  JobTracker is a free service dedicated to reaching out to help those who are struggling. If you want that motivation, or if you just want a simple, convenient way to track your applications, sign up today!
